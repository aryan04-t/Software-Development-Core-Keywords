# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I am **Aryan Tomar**. Today is 1st December 2025 when I am creating this Repo, and right now I am 21 years old (turning 22 in a month). I graduated with a B. Tech. in CSE (4-year program) in August 2025, and I am a Software Developer by profession.

Software development is really vast, really really vast. I started seriously exploring it consciously and curiously on my own from September 2022 when I was 18 years old and I was in the 2nd year of my Engineering, I still remember it was 2nd Month of my 2nd year's 1st sem - the OG **Sept. 2022** - I changed my approach towards life that day when I finally decided to pursue CSE seriously, when I finally decided to earn money seriously and become independant. 

I didn't even know what a variable in programming langauge meant until September 2022, even though my 2nd year of B. Tech. CSE had started in August 2022. My 12th grade and half of 1st year of my engineering went in online mode during the COVID-19 lockdown, that's why I didn't study at all in my - half 11th, complete 12th, and complete 1st year of my engineering - I was always lazy, and always in my comfort zone. But in September 2022, I decided to seriously start studying CS (Computer Science), so that I could earn money in the future and be independent, as I hate being financially dependent on anyone since I turned 18 years old.


# 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

So, I have explored a bit of Software Development till now - its been 3 years and 2 months now since I have been exploring software development, and it is very vast. I just want to categorize the keywords of core software development which I have explored till this date as a software developer. These keywords help me zoom out from my current learnings and they help me visualize the working of the Software Development field as I see the bigger picture.
